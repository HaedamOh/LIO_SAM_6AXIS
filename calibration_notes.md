# Transformation Convention Summary

In transformations between frames A and B:

- **Subscript** denotes the frame that the vector is expressed in.
- **Superscript** denotes the frame that the vector is transformed into.

## Transforming from Frame A to Frame B and Expressing Frame A in Frame B

- **Notation**: \( T_{AB} \) (Transformation from frame A to frame B) and \( ^B T_A \) (Frame A expressed in frame B)
- **Interpretation**: A relative to B
- **Example**: Transforming a vector from frame A to frame B or expressing the position or orientation of frame A relative to frame B
